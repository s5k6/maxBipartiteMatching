    Dependency tree exhaustively searched.

Tried to remove the upper bounds on all dependencies in
`graph-matching.cabal`, so that the respective line reads:

    Build-depends: base >= 4, containers >= 0.4, array >= 0.3
                 , transformers >= 0.2.2

This fails with a syntax error, which I cannot fix

    /tmp/graph-matching$ cabal build
